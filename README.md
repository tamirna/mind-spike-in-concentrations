# miND-spikein-report

Small script to read in data- and metadata files from the IMI TBL miND project and calculate concentrations.

See file "miND-spikein.R" for more details on how to run this and what to expect as output.

Make sure to set at least the variable "input_data_path" at the top of the script to define the directory where the input data is stored. Also install all needed libraries (tidyverse and gridExtra) befor running the script.
